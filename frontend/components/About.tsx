        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
          I am a seasoned hairstylist with over 25 years of experience and a proud mother of two amazing young adults.
          I began my career at just 16 years old and, after a period working as a medical assistant, rediscovered my
          true passion in the hair industry. For the past five years, I have successfully owned and operated my own
          salon suite, specializing in weddings and special event hairstyling. I take pride in creating styles that
          make my clients look and feel their absolute best whether for everyday confidence or once-in-a-lifetime occasions.

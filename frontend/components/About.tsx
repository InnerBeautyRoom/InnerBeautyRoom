        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
          I am a seasoned hairstylist with over 25 years of experience and a
          proud mother of two amazing young adults. I began my career at just
          16 years old and, after a period working as a medical assistant,
          rediscovered my true passion in the hair industry. For the past five
          years, I have successfully owned and operated my own salon suite,
          specializing in weddings and special event hairstyling. I take pride
          in creating styles that make my clients look and feel their absolute
          best whether for everyday confidence or once-in-a-lifetime occasions.
